# Methodology

This part houses my master's thesis' associated methodology:

## LiDAR Sensor Modeling
A comprehensive guide to modeling the KITTI LiDAR sensor with AVX. Explore [readme](./Sensor_Modeling/README.md) for details.

## Ansys AVxcelerate and CarMaker Co-simulation
This section focuses on the co-simulation framework, combining physics-based LiDAR modeling with vehicle dynamics simulation. Dive into [readme](./AVX_CarMaker_Cosimulation/README.md) to understand more.

## Simulation Outputs
Discussion around LiDAR point cloud, contribution output, and CarMaker output quantities. For processing and exploring these outputs, check out [readme](./Simulation_Outputs/README.md)

## Processing
Handling the output point cloud data to generate the ground truth labels needed for neural network training. See [readme](./Processing/README.md) for more information.

## Scaling Simulated Scenarios
Python scripts used to organize and scale up simulated scenarios. See [readme](./Scaling_Simulated_Scenarios/README.md) for more information.
